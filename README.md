# KIT.min
This repository is a starting point for consumers of the [KIT C++ Library](https://github.com/Integerfox/kit.core). i.e. clone this repo instead of the [kit.core](https://github.com/Integerfox/kit.core) repository.  The `kit.core` repository is the _development_ repository for the library.  

The `kit.min` is a structured as a _mono-repo_ which can be updated with newer versions of the `kit.core` using the [Outcast tool](https://github.com/johnttaylor/Outcast)

The repository contains the **minimum** set of the features, platforms, third-party packages, etc. supported by the KIT library.  If you want the _full_ features/platform set - use the [kit.all](https://github.com/Integerfox/kit.all) repository
